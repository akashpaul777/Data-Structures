##STACK

The stack data structure is a works on the princiiples of First In Last out **FILO** or the Last in  First out **LIFO**
This stack is based on a linked list. The linked list has two methods addHead(item) and removeHead() that run in constant time. These two methods are suitable to implement a stack. 

1. getSize()– Get the number of items in the stack.
2. isEmpty() – Return True if the stack is empty, False otherwise.
3. peek() – Return the top item in the stack. If the stack is empty, raise an exception.
4. push(value) – Push a value into the head of the stack.
5. pop() – Remove and return a value in the head of the stack. If the stack is empty, raise an exception.
